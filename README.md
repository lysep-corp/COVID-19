There is something weird going on about our country's data. There is a little bit difference about goverment's all time data and daily datas. If we gonna add everyday's data to each other, Our calculation is **3091** less than the goverment's case calculation. It's **30** for deaths, **26504** for tests and **437** for cured person count. We don't know why our country is doing that. ARE THE DATAS WRONG??!?
