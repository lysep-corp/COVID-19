There is something weird going on about our country's data. There is a little bit difference about goverment's all time data and daily datas. If we gonna add everyday's data to each other, Our calculation is **1420** less than the goverment's case calculation. It's **1** for deaths, **87361** for tests and **1027** for cured person count. We don't know why our country is doing that. ARE THE DATAS WRONG??!?\
Okey, let's talk about the graphs. Here is today's data is compare with yesterdays:\
