Note: All the data coming from Türk Ministery of Health's public website. If datas are not up-to-date, probably this is about the [goverment's website](https://covid19.saglik.gov.tr) if our server's are not die. Okey, Let's start than! \

There is something weird going on about our country's data. There is a little bit difference about goverment's All Time data and daily datas. If we gonna add everyday's data to each other, Our calculation is **%(difference_case)s** less than the goverment's case calculation. It's **%(difference_deaths)s** for deaths, **%(difference_tests)s** for tests and **%(difference_cures)s** for cured person count. We don't know why our country is doing that.
